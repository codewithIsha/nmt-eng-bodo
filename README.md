# nmt-eng-bodo
# Introduction
This GitHub project aims to provide a neural machine translation (NMT) system using transformers to translate text between the Bodo and English languages. The project utilizes the power of transformers, a state-of-the-art deep learning model architecture, to achieve accurate and efficient translation results.

Neural machine translation is a subfield of natural language processing that focuses on automatically translating text from one language to another. This project specifically targets translation between the Bodo and English languages. It utilizes transformers, a deep learning architecture that has proven to be highly effective for various NLP tasks.

# 🌐 Extended Contributions — Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT)

> 🔍 Expanding the frontier of **low-resource NLP** for North-East Indian languages.

---

## 🎯 Vision

This multilingual extension builds upon the English–Bodo NMT system and evolves into a full-fledged **Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT)** architecture.  
It aims to empower several underrepresented languages in Northeast India with high-quality translation systems using scalable Transformer-based models.

## 🌍 Supported Language Pairs

The project has been extended to support ** translation** between English and the following languages :

- 🇮🇳 **English ↔️ Assamese**
- 🇮🇳 **English ↔️ Khasi**
- 🇮🇳 **English ↔️ Mizo**
- 🇮🇳 **English ↔️ Manipuri**
- 🇳🇵 **English ↔️ Nepali**

## 🧠 More Project

> ✨ **Multilingual Neural Machine Translation model using transformer for low resource language with shared and decoders**

-  Cleaned and tokenized **parallel corpora**
- Language-aware **subword tokenization**
- Transformer **encoder-decoder architecture**
  
- 🗂️ **Based on anguage group**:
  - **Indo-Aryan**: Assamese, Nepali
  - **Tibeto-Burman**: Bodo, Manipuri, Mizo
  - **Austroasiatic**: Khasi

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate translation quality, the following metrics were used:

| Metric        | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **BLEU**      | Measures n-gram precision with reference translations |
| **METEOR**    | Accounts for stemming, synonyms, and recall           |
| **ROUGE**     | Used especially for recall and summarization quality |
| **TER**       | Translation Edit Rate (lower is better)              |
| **sacreBLEU** | Standardized BLEU with consistent evaluation settings |

These were computed per language pair to track performance and guide model tuning.
